## About Me

Hi, I’m **Linh Pham** — an undergraduate student at Duke Kunshan & Duke University.  
I’m excited about everything in **AI**, especially how people experience intelligent systems and how we can design them to be more understandable and supportive. I also enjoy working with **VR and games** as practical environments for prototyping ideas and building interactive demos. I like experimenting with new tools, learning through making, and turning concepts into small systems that people can try out.

I’m someone who learns by making, and I enjoy collaborating, sharing ideas, and meeting people who are excited about technology and design. This website is a place where I share my projects, interests, and the things I'm currently exploring. Thanks for stopping by!
