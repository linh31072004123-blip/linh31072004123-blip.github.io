## Overview

This project is a **2D side-scrolling platformer** inspired by classic platforming mechanics.
Built in Unity using C#, it explores **jump physics**, **moving platforms**, **hazard timing**,  
and **level layout design** across floating islands.

The player navigates through obstacles, moving platforms, and hidden collectibles,  
testing timing skills, spatial awareness, and precise controls.

## 🎯 Impact

This project strengthened my foundation in 2D game design and real-time systems.
Rebuilding core platformer mechanics from scratch—jump physics, hazard timing, collision handling, and level layout—taught me how tightly technical decisions shape the final feel of a game.
Through iterative playtesting, I learned how small adjustments to gravity, acceleration, jump height, or platform spacing could completely change player flow, difficulty, and satisfaction. Implementing collectibles, camera behavior, and modular tile-based levels also helped me understand how system components interact to create a coherent gameplay experience.
Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience with building complete gameplay loops, balancing challenge, and designing responsive, polished interactions—skills that continue to inform my broader approach to designing interactive systems.
