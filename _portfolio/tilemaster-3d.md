## Overview

**Tile Master 3D** is a Unity-built 3D puzzle game where players match groups of identical objects by collecting them into slots.  
The challenge grows as the board fills with dozens of small 3D items, requiring quick recognition, spatial scanning, and fast decision-making.

The project blends **mobile-style UX**, **3D object management**, and **lightweight physics**, giving it the feel of a polished casual game.

## 🧩 Key Features

- **3D Object Interaction System**  
  Players tap to collect objects into a matching stack, with auto-sorting and removal once three identical items are grouped.

- **Dynamic Object Spawning & Layouts**  
  Grid-based and scatter-based level generation to vary difficulty and encourage quick visual scanning.

- **Smooth Mobile Controls**  
  Single-tap selection, animated pickups, slot highlighting, and feedback cues.

- **Progressive Difficulty Design**  
  Increasing object variety, crowding density, and time pressure across levels.

- **Optimized Rendering Pipeline**  
  Lightweight shaders, batching, and LOD controls for mobile-ready performance.

- **Visual Polish & Animation**  
  Bounce animations, scaling feedback, outlines, particles, and positive reinforcement for correct matches.

## 🎯 Impact

Developing Tile Master 3D gave me hands-on experience with designing
readable, intuitive 3D interactions and maintaining clarity even when the
screen is crowded with small objects. Building the matching system, feedback
animations, and level progression strengthened my understanding of how players
scan, sort, and make decisions under time pressure.

This project also became a useful contrast to my 2D platformer work.
Working in 3D revealed different challenges in visual clarity, object grouping,
and attention guidance—insights that I plan to build on when comparing how
players interact with 2D versus 3D puzzle environments in future projects.
Seeing firsthand how dimensionality changes player perception and strategy has
given me a foundation for exploring interaction differences more systematically.
