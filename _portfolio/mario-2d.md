## Overview

This project is a **2D side-scrolling platformer** inspired by classic platforming mechanics.  
Built in Unity using C#, it explores **jump physics**, **moving platforms**,  
**hazard timing**, and **level layout design** across floating islands.

The player navigates obstacles, moving platforms, and hidden collectibles,  
testing timing skills, spatial awareness, and precise controls.

## 🎯 Impact

This project strengthened my foundation in **2D game design and real-time systems**. Rebuilding core platformer mechanics—from jump physics to hazard timing and collision logic—taught me how small timing and physics adjustments can dramatically change the feel of a game. Iterating on level layouts helped me understand how pacing, spacing, and player skill progression affect engagement.  

Overall, this project gave me hands-on experience building a **complete gameplay loop**, tuning difficulty, and crafting responsive moment-to-moment interactions.
