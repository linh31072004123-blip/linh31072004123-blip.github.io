## Overview

**Flappy Bird** is a recreation of the classic arcade game, built in **Unity** using **C#**. This project helped me practice game physics, procedural generation, and clean, modular gameplay architecture.

Players tap/click to flap, navigating through randomly generated pipes that increase difficulty over time.

## 🎯 Impact

Building this game strengthened my foundation in real-time interaction design.Recreating a fast-paced 2D experience forced me to think carefully about **responsiveness**, **timing**, and **feedback loops**—the same mechanics that now shape my work in VR and adaptive AI.

Implementing physics-based controls, procedural content, and performance-aware object pooling showed me how small technical decisions influence how players perceive challenge, flow, and fairness. These early lessons became the groundwork for my advanced Unity projects, including immersive VR systems and AI-driven
adaptive interactions where user agency and interpretability matter just as much as technical performance.
