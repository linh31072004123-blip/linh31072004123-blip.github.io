# Quick Portfolio

This page contains a **fast, consolidated overview** of my key projects in:
- Virtual Reality (VR)  
- Adaptive & AI-driven systems  
- Game development (2D + 3D)  
- UX/UI and interaction design  

It is ideal for **application reviewers**, **recruiters**, and **professors** who want to see the full breadth of my work at a glance.
